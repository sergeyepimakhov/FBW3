# Webpack

The outdated way to import dependencies:

```html
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/handlebars.js/4.1.2/handlebars.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script srt="app.js"></script>
```

This way has two cons:

- First, the global namespace gets polluted with a lot of global variables.
- Second, we have to care about all our dependencies by ourselves: either download or search for cdn links.

The (Webpack)[https://webpack.js.org] allows to bundle your code easily.  it helps to eliminate the implicit dependency on sorted script tags in our markup. Instead of including many separate scripts, we include single or few bundles using the same script tag.

```html
    <script srt="bundle.js"></script>
```

Bundle should be installed first of all in our system:

    npm install webpack --save-dev

Bundle the code:

    ./node_modules/.bin/webpack input.js

Now you can find under the ```dist``` the ```main.js``` file

# House of Rising Sun

    There is a house in New Orleans
    They call the Rising Sun
    And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
    And God I know I'm one

    My mother was a tailor
    She sewed my new blue jeans
    My father was a gamblin' man
    Down in New Orleans

    Now the only thing a gambler needs
    Is a suitcase and trunk
    And the only time he's satisfied
    Is when he's all drunk

    Oh mother tell your children
    Not to do what I have done
    Spend your lives in sin and misery
    In the House of the Rising Sun

    Well, I got one foot on the platform
    The other foot on the train
    I'm goin' back to New Orleans
    To wear that ball and chain

    Well, there is a house in New Orleans
    They call the Rising Sun
    And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
    And God I know I'm one

# Put text of the song into a separate file
# Add font

To summarize, to avoid any font related errors with webpack, you need to download file-loader, integrate it within your webpack config, and import whatever fonts you wish to use into your CSS or SCSS files. If you have some local font files of your own, place them in a font directory within src and reference them within .style.scss using @font-face as you normally wouldâ€”webpack will see that you're referencing a font file and run it through the file-loader like it did with Font Awesome and Google Fonts.

main.scss:
```scss
 @font-face {
    font-family: FoundersGrotesk;

         url('./fonts/FoundersGroteskWeb-Bold.woff2') format('woff2');
    font-weight: bold;
