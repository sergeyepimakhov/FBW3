## Useful Commands

### Development

Run **Webpack** in **Development** mode and start coding!

```
npm start
```

### Production

Run **Webpack** in **Production** mode.

```
npm run build
```

### Deploy to Github Pages

Deploy your code to **Github Pages**: this script creates a 'gh-pages' branch and serves the production bundle to this branch. For this to work, make sure you already have a remote repo on github.

```
npm run deploy
```



1. Write the text of the song and the title in a separate js file and import it import in the ```Ã¬ndex.js```. Hint you might use
multiline text representation using backquotes in JS2016 like this:

```javascript
export const text = `
    There is a house in New Orleans
    They call the Rising Sun
    And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
    And God I know I'm one
`;
```

```javascript
export const myTitle = 'House of the Rising Sun';
```

2. Find a nice font apply to the title. We recommend to download the file in format **ttf**. The font can be imported into your scss file as follows:
```scss
@font-face {
  font-family: 'MyWebFont';
  src: url('../fonts/Rockit.ttf')  format('truetype')
}
```

Then it can be used directly:
```scss
#title {
  font-family: 'MyWebFont';
}
```

3. Put your font definition into a separate file ```font.css``` and use import to get it imported in ```main.scss```
```scss
@import "./font.css";
```

4. Play around with styling.
